###

This document will show you how to use the small piece of code to build a simple running solar system.

Before downloading this project, make sure you have any IDE supporting JavaFx(NetBeans, IntelliJ Idea, etc...)

###


Step 1: Download the whole project on your machine and open it with a Java IDE.

Step 2: Look through the .java files in src/sample. 
        (Ignore the useless sample.fxml and controller.java, pay more attention to the ExampleStar Class)

Step 3: Open Main.java and have a look at the method initializeSolarSystem(). 
        This is where you can customise your version of solar system.
        In the example we provided, the Sun is the central star and there are five planets defined underneath.

Step 4: Review the constructor of ExampleStar Class and modify the code in initializeSolarSystem()

Finally, give it a run and enjoy the beauty of the universe!
